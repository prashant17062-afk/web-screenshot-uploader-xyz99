# Screenshot Uploader

## Summary

This web application allows users to upload .png screenshots and display them in the browser. It provides a simple interface for uploading and viewing images.

## Setup

1.  Save the `index.html` file to your local machine.
2.  Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Usage

1.  Click the "Choose File" button to select a .png screenshot from your computer.
2.  Click the "Upload" button to display the screenshot.
3.  The uploaded screenshot will be displayed in the designated area.

## Main Code Logic

The `index.html` file contains the HTML structure, CSS styling, and JavaScript logic for the application.

-   **HTML:** Defines the structure of the page, including the upload form and the image display area.
-   **CSS:** Styles the page elements for a better user experience.
-   **JavaScript:** Handles the file upload process and displays the selected image. The `uploadScreenshot()` function reads the selected file using `FileReader` and sets the `src` attribute of the `screenshotImage` element to display the image.
